# Code-Challenge-1# Week 1 Code Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the Week 1 Code Challenge, where we implement JavaScript functions to solve practical problems related to daily life in Kenya. The challenges include calculating ingredients for Kenyan chai, estimating boda boda fare, and determining mobile money transaction fees.

## Repository Structure
Each challenge is placed in a separate folder within this repository:
- `chaiCalculator/` - Contains the solution for the Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator.
- `bodaFareCalculator/` - Houses the Boda Boda Fare Estimator.
- `mobileMoneyEstimator/` - Includes the Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator.

Each folder contains a single JavaScript file:
